# Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot Set can be defined using this simple pseudocode algorithm.

```
for each pixel (Px, Py) on the screen do
    x0 := scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.00, 0.47))
    y0 := scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1.12, 1.12))
    x := 0.0
    y := 0.0
    iteration := 0
    max_iteration := 1000
    while (x^2 + y^2 â‰¤ 2^2 AND iteration < max_iteration) do
        xtemp := x^2 - y^2 + x0
        y := 2*x*y + y0
        x := xtemp
        iteration := iteration + 1
```

## System

We're using an R5 5600H with an integrated GPU for the tests.

Clangd with the -O3 flag is used as a compiler.

## Naive Approach

Let's rewrite the pseudocode in C.

I have also applied various optimization techniques to make the code run faster, but those are basic and can be found anywhere on the Internet, and we are not going to discuss those.

The resulting time is 144.0 seconds per 1000 frames, which is around 7 FPS.

## Vectorized Approach

The most significant feature of this algorithm is that it can be parallelized as much as you would like.

For example, if you have 1920*1080 CPUs, they can simultaneously calculate each frame and output the result instantaneously.

Modern CPUs have so-called SIMD instructions (Single Instruction Multiple Data), and those can be very handy since they can perform multiple operations at once.

My CPU supports AVX2 instructions, meaning that we can perform up to 8 floating-point multiplications at once.

Let's rewrite our code and test it again.

The resulting time is 24.0 seconds, or around 42 FPS.

However, we were expecting an 8 times increase and 49 FPS. Where did we lose the 7 FPS?

Firstly, the time it takes to calculate a vector of 8 floats is defined by the slowest pixel, which can ruin the performance.

Secondly, we still have to look up colors for each pixel one by one.

But, in reality, we came close to the theoretical limit, which is quite good.

## Multithreading Approach

As far as I know, we have hit the limit of single-thread speed, so let's add more threads.

My CPU has 12 threads. We will use them all. We are going to split our screen horizontally into 12 pieces and calculate them in parallel.

The resulting time is 5.6 seconds or around 179 FPS.

Again, our expectations were incorrect, and we only gained 4 times extra frames instead of 12.

Similar to the previous case, the total speed is defined by the slowest thread. And if the 8 neighboring pixels had approximately the same time to compute, the threads were spread even more poorly.

The threads that are calculating the central parts are working non-stop, and the first ones are generally resting.

| Thread number | Idling time |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| 1             | 92%         |
| 2             | 90%         |
| 3             | 84%         |
| 4             | 63%         |
| 5             | 44%         |
| 6             | 10%         |

That leads us to the next approach.

## Unfair Approach

Since we know the rendering algorithm in advance, we can spread the computations evenly between threads.

| Thread number |  Surface area |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| 1             | 27.3%        |
| 2             | 6.5%         |
| 3             | 5.2%         |
| 4             | 4.2%         |
| 5             | 3.4%         |
| 6             | 3.4%         |

We were able to reduce the execution time to 3.52 seconds or 284 FPS, which is a 7 times increase.

Even after evenly spreading the computations between the threads, we are still far away from our desired 12x increase in speed.

Since each core on my CPU has two threads, it cannot fully work twice as fast:
- Each core only has a single instance of L3 cache
- It takes time to create and manage threads
- Different cores access different parts of memory.

## Conclusion
After exploring several optimization approaches for the Mandelbrot set calculation, the following results were achieved:
| Approach              | Naive  | Vectorized | Multithreading | Multithreading (unfair) |
|-----------------------|:------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------:|
| FPS                   | 7      | 42         | 179            | 284                     |
| Time (sec)            | 144.0  | 24.00      | 5.60           | 3.52                    |
